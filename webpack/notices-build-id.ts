// #region shared with https://github.com/paranext/paranext-multi-extension-template/blob/main/webpack/notices-build-id.ts

// The code matches paranext-core's `.erb/scripts/notices-build-id.ts` apart from how it finds the
// manifest folder. Keep the two in step: paranext-core's third-party notices generator reads the
// stamp this writes.

/**
 * Stamps one identity on every module manifest a single build produces.
 *
 * The web-view and main webpack configurations each write a module manifest
 * (`.notices/modules/*.json`), and paranext-core's notices generator unions them into one list of
 * bundled packages. Without a shared stamp, manifests from two different builds are
 * indistinguishable, and a stale manifest silently shortens that list.
 *
 * Run as both `prebuild` and `prebuild:production`. npm runs a `pre` script only for the script of
 * the same name, and `npm run package` calls `build:production`, so a `prebuild` alone would never
 * run before a packaged build. When this file is absent the plugin stamps each manifest with its
 * own `unstamped-` value, the manifests disagree, and the generator refuses them.
 *
 * What this does NOT catch: the file persists between builds, so building one configuration on its
 * own afterwards (`npm run build:main`) re-stamps its manifest with the same id. Package with `npm
 * run package`, which runs this first.
